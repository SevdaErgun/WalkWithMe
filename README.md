## walkwithme Application

Dog owners have plans in their lives. Within these plans, they can have engagements that may hinder their availability for walking their dogs. In this flow, they may encounter difficulties in finding time to spend with their dogs. To eliminate this problem, we have developed a mobile application. This application is designed for dog owners to delegate the task of walking their dogs to selected walkers within a specific time frame. As a result, dog owners can save time by assigning the walking activity to the walker during their busy periods without disrupting their workflow. During the scheduled walking times, dog owners will have the opportunity to track live information about their dogs. This will eliminate any concerns regarding trust.

## Functioning of the Application

There are two types of roles: Walkers and Dog Owners.

Dog Owners can have multiple dogs. Each dog can walk with only one Walker during a specific time period. Walkers can view the Dog Owners' listings and choose the ones that do not conflict with their schedules. These requests will be visible in the notifications of the listing owners. When Dog Owners select Walkers, a notification is sent to initiate the walking process. Walkers can view their own walking history, and this applies to Dog Owners as well.
